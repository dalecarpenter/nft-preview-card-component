## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) - A tool for automating routine CSS tasks with Javascript plugins
  - [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) - For adding vendor prefixes to improve browser compatibility
  - [cssnano](https://cssnano.co/) - Minifies CSS to reduce file size.

### Continued development

As this is my first time using Tailwind, I would like to continue exploring it's application in future projects, particularly the implementation of a full custom design system in the config file for a larger scale project.

### Useful resources

- [Polypane](https://polypane.app/) - A web browser specifically for developers. Although not a true replacement for Chrome, it provides an incredible suite of tools for devs. Outlining, accessibility, checking best practices, viewing all layouts in a single window and much more.
- [tailwindcss Official Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - Some of the best official documentation I've ever read. Clear, concise and thorough. Rendered additional tutorials completely unnecessary.
